# Christian Di Guida's Portfolio

My name is Christian and I am a Junior Web Developer. I have been passionate about computer technology since I was a child but I started to study development since 6 months. During this time I have learned some of the most used web technologies through online and professional courses.

This repository will contain all my public projects for business and academic purposes. Feel free to get in touch, look around and be inspired.
